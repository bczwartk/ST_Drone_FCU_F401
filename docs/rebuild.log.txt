     IAR Command Line Build Utility V9.1.1.9611
     Copyright 2002-2022 IAR Systems AB.


 Usage:
 iarbuild <projectfile> [mode] <config> [options].


 Parameter:	Description:

 <projectfile>	Your IAR Embedded Workbench project file (project.ewp).

 <config>	The name of the configuration you want to process,
		which can either be one of the predefined configurations
		Debug or Release, or a name that you define yourself.
		By using a comma separated list it is possible to
		process multiple configurations.
		Using * (wild card character), all configurations
		defined in the project will be processed.


 Mode:		Description:

 -update	Updates the options to use latest version,
		creating a backup with the old settings.
		No configuration specification is needed.

 -clean		Removes any intermediate and output files.

 -build		Rebuilds and relinks all files in the current
		build configuration.

 -make		Brings the current build configuration up to date
		by compiling, assembling, and linking only the files
		that have changed since the last build.

 -jsondb	Generate the IAR json database, producing a
		JSON based build description file of the project.
		See -output option to specify outputfile.

 -ninja		Generate the ninja build file from the current configuration.

 -cstat_analyze	Analyzes the project using C-STAT and generates
		information about the number of messages.
		For more information, see the C-STAT Static Analysis Guide.

 -cstat_cmds	Generate the cstatcommands.txt based on the
		settings in the current configuration.

 -cstat_report	Generate the full C-STAT report based on the
		C-STAT database of the configuration.

 -cstat_clean	Cleans the C-STAT message database for the project.
		For more information, see the C-STAT Static Analysis Guide.


 Option:	Description:

 -log errors	Display build error messages.

 -log warnings	Display build warning and error messages.

 -log info	Display build warning and error messages, and messages
		issued by the #pragma message preprocessor directive.

 -log all	Display all messages generated from the build,
		for example compiler sign-on information and the
		full command line.

 -parallel	Specifies the number of parallel processes to run the
 <number>	compiler in to make better use of the cores in the CPU.

 -varfile	Makes custom argument variables defined in a workspace
 <argvarfile>	scope available to the build engine by specifying the
		file to use.

 -output	Specify the output file for the IAR compilation database.
 <filename> 

 -tool		Specify the tool to use. Use '-tool list' to list available tools.
 <toolname>
